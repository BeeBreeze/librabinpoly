random-42x1M.dat was generated using 'test/mkrandom 42 1048576' with
python 2.7.6.

pmlog.dat is an interesting file; arbitrary ASCII log text, exactly
three blocks long, each block exactly 64k in size.  It exposed a
one-off error when I was writing and testing examples/hash_md5.
Restructuring the code to help prevent future devs (including myself)
from making this sort of error is what triggered me moving to the
state-machine-based API.
